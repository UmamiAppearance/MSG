# MSG

## Description
__MSG__ - Monosodium glutamate - that's the stuff in tomatos and cheese that makes your mouse water. The artificially produced molecule is the shortcut to achieve this result. A css library for quick demonstrations. If you ever feel the need to throw some style at a (static) webpage, you have to decide which framework to use, and learn/use the semantics of the framework. The job of MSG is to overwrite the default styling of html-elements, to look more pretty. And that's it. Right now it is in early, early stage of developement. Which is happening on the fly. If a feature is needed, it is added.

## Usage
Just bind it into your webpage as any other css.
