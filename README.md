# MSG

## Description
__MSG__ - Monosodium glutamate - that's the stuff in tomatos and cheese that makes your mouse water. The artificially produced molecule is the shortcut to achieve this result. This is what this css - framework? right now it is only a file - is about. If you ever feel the need to throw some style at a (static) webpage, you have to decide which framework to use, and learn/use the semantics of the framework. The job of MSG is to overwrite the default styling of html-elements, to look more pretty. And that's it. Right now it is in early, early stage of developement.   

## Usage
Just bind it into your webpage as any other css.
